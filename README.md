## About The Project
  
There are many great templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. 
 
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
